## oizys

- [ ] make interoperable with a single command so first installation can be ran by root as:
  ```sh
  nix --extra-experimental-features 'flakes nix-command' run "github:daylinmorgan/oiyzs" switch --host <host>
  ```

## software

- [ ] lid closed does not engage hyprlock?
- [ ] include langservers for enabled languages?

## hardware

      possibly resolved with latest kernel, see above

## oizys

## software

- [ ] switch systemd desktop file to libvirt VM
- [ ] why is my update ci always building llm and rofi?
- [ ] include langservers for enabled languages?
<!--[tracking issue](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/5990)-->
- [ ] ~wezterm is broken...something to do with fonts?~ using ghostty
- [ ] hplip is failing to build..disabling hp-scanner module on othalan in the mean time

VS Code is crashing when the computer is inactive?
Unclear if this problem is due to VSCode, hypridle, or hyprlock.
Is this related to above and could maybe resolved by settling on a stable version of hyprland and friends?

### Window Manager

- [ ] install more of the software as systemd services?
- [ ] lid closed does not engage hyprlock?

## hardware

- [ ] monitor the presence of these kernel messages on `othalan`,
      possibly resolved with latest kernel, see above
  > kernel: ucsi_acpi USBC000:00: possible UCSI driver bug 2
  > kernel: ucsi_acpi USBC000:00: error -EINVAL: PPM init failed
